# -Serverless-Form-Submission-App-on-AWS

his project is a serverless web application designed to collect and store user data â€” such as name, age, profession, and years of experience â€” through a simple form hosted on an S3 static website.

The backend is fully serverless and uses AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB to process and store submissions. An SNS notification is triggered on each new entry, providing real-time alerts.

Talent acquisition forms
Customer intake for services
Internal employee surveys
